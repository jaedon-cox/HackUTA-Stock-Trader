# HackUTA-Stock-Trader
This is a personal AI Stock Market Predictor. It will use current stock market data to calculate trends among data so that a neural network can find the best value day trades in a given day.

It uses python libraries among the back end such as TensorFlow, Pandas, Numpy, FastAPI.
This allows the backend to run simultaneously with the frontend website that it is linked to.

The frontend is created using React and Node.js. Builder.io's Visual-Copilot helped to create the base 
website. The connection of the API and major details were created with Tailwind CSS and other
notable frontend libraries.
